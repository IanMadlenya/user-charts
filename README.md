Charts based on 'mini-kep' macroeconomic dataset

## Workflow milestones

1. data access code - use similar code to retrieve data from API across all samples
2. similar graphics - recyclce code for the graphs
3. find a chart to replicate or describe a new one
4. arrange and comment some graphs 
5. make dedicated ipyhton notebooks

## Chart ideas

- retail time series (started)
- BoR inflation (as in link)
- GDP components (got sample)
- fx: oil vs rouble (got sample)
- bank provisions
