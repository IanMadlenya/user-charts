Charts based on 'mini-kep' macroeconomic dataset

## Workflow milestones

- data access code - use similar code to retrieve data from API across all samples
- similar graphics - recyclce code for the graphs
- find a chart to replicate or describe a new one
- arrange and comment some graphs 
- make dedicated ipyhton notebooks

## Chart ideas

- retail time series (started)
- BoR inflation (as in link)
- GDP components (got sample)
- fx: oil vs rouble (got sample)
- bank provisions
